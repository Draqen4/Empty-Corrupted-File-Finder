# Empty / Corrupted file finder for Windows

This tool scans your computer for any files which are 0 bytes in size. Often a file that gets corrupted becomes 0 bytes.

Instructions:
1. Download the compiled EXE and run it.
2. Select the folder you'd like to scan, and if you'd like to scan sub-directories.
3. Click the "Find zero byte files" button.
4. If any 0 byte files are detected, a list will open up detailing them. Double click to go to them in explorer, right click to delete them or copy their path.
